# Node API with MongoDb
This project showcases what we've learned to make an api that will access a "movie" collection in our mongoDB database

## To get started

1. After cloning project install dependencies with `npm i`
2. Connect to MongoDB (if local start with `brew services start mongo-community)
3. Run API with nodemon

## How to use it: 
you can add new movies by sending a valid JSON body to```http://localhost:4001/add-movie``` and get movies by going to ```http://localhost:4001/get-movies```
